###What did you do this past week?###

This past week was more relaxed mainly due to the fact that we do not yet
have a project assigned. We did cover an interesting and complex topic:
function argument passing. Python not only supports positional arguments
(which is what most languages support), but keyword arguments, unpacked
argument lists/dicts, and arbitrary argument lists. One of the most suprising
examples was

{% highlight python %}

def f(x, y, z):
    return [x, y, z]

a = {'x' : 1, 'y' : 2, 'z' : 3}

f(**a)

{% endhighlight %}

This is a legal way to call functions. The reason this surprises me is that
this means Python does not erase function parameter names at runtime, which
is a common thing in many languages. However, no one ever claimed Python was
like many other languages...

###What's in your way?###

So far this class hasn't presented any new challenges. As I mentioned, not
much has been happening outside of class. There is the first exam looming
ahead though.

###What will you do next week?###

This next week will be focused on preparing for the first exam on Thursday,
i.e. going over the lecture notes, revisiting the Python examples, etc.

###Tip of the Week###

[Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html)

This isn't strictly relevant to software engineering, but I know that many
people in CS like to make LaTeX documents. This is a quick and easy tool to
figure out how to insert that arcane symbol into your document. It's nice
because sometimes you only know what the symbol looks like and not what it's
called. Just draw it in the box and it will do its best to figure it out.
