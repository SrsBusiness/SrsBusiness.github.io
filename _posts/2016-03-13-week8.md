###What did you do this past week?###

This past week we mainly discussed our next project IDB1. It is part 1 of
a bigger project. The end product is effectively IMDB but for something
other than movies. Our group's topic will be Marvel comics superheroes.
Currently our proposed models are characters, comics, and creators. This week
we also went over some of the technologies we would need to used for the
project. In particular, we spent a lecture going over Rackspace's cloud-based
Linux container technology with a Rackspace engineer. He went over how to set
things up, good practices he recommends, and bad practices he recommends
against. For example, one of the things he drilled in to us was that we should
not treat our containers like a VM. I think it has to do with the fact that
containers are more like specially managed processes rather than VMs. Whatever
the true reason is, I'll be sure to keep his advice in mind.

###What's in your way?###

Learning the new technologies (Rackspace, SQLAlchemy, Apiary, etc.). Also
readjusting after spring break.

###What will you do next week?###

I plan on having a rather relaxed spring break.

###Tip of the Week###

[Astyle](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/)

A useful command-line utility that will format source files according to some
well-known conventions. Examples of the coding conventions it supports are GNU,
Stallman, K&R, Google, and more. Works on C, C++, Java, Objective C, and C#.
