###What did you do this past week?###

This week in class we have been introduced to a new kind of algebra, called
relational algebra. The language has to deaL with relational databases. Not
surprisingly, it is similar to SQL and it shares many operations like select
and join. So far we have just been talking about some operations on tables
and their implementation in Python. Previously, my only experience with
databases has been from internships and what I've read on my own time, so this
is my first formal training on databases.

Additionally, my group for project IDB (our topic is Marvel Comics)
was scrambling to get the first
checkpoint done this week. We all decided that we would start after Spring
Break, which in hindsight was not the wisest decision. For this first
checkpoint we focused mainly on the database models, our RESTful API, and
some static pages that capture the look of our website. In addition, there
are some other requirements like a technical report (in the form of a wiki),
writing unit tests, etc. For this first checkpoint, I was mainly responsible
for the technical report, documenting our API on Apiary, and scraping data from
the Marvel website for our static pages. Figuring out how to use Marvel's API
and writing a basic script to scrape their API was the most fun I had with this
assignment. It wasn't just simple HTTP GET requests because they implemented
their own authentication scheme. On a side note, I found their authentication
system suspect, particularly for their use of md5, a deprecated hashing algorithm,
and the fact that their "public" and "private" keys weren't really
public/private keys. Nevertheless, it was the perfect oppurtunity to make use
of my "expertise" in Bash.

###What's in your way?###

Since I haven't had any formal training in relational databases, I am unfamiliar
with some of the operations on tables being discussed in class. I'll have to read
up on those.

###What will you do next week?###

With how much fun I had with the scraper I wrote in part 1 of our project, I'm
looking forward to writing a more robust scraper that we will actually use to
populate our own database for IDB. Aside from that it will be the usual week
in CS373.

###Tip of the Week###

Working with Marvel's API has reminded me of this piece of advice I've learned.
When implementing security in your applications, stick with what's known to
work. Avoid cryptographic algorithms or security schemse that have been
deprecated, like md5. Even if you think your own particular usecase of some
vulnerable algorithm is special enough to be safe, history as taught us that
the ramifications of incorrectly implementing security are hard to foresee and
almost always disastrous.
