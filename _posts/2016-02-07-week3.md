###What did you do this past week?###

This past week was spent mainly on Collatz. I think it was a good learning
experience since I've never used Travis CI alongside my GitHub projects. This
is something I'll definitely be using in the future.

###What's in your way?###

I had some challenges mainly with the logistics of the Collatz assignment. I
found the requirements like "make 15 issues" and "have at least 3 unit tests
per function" awkward and somewhat arbitrary. I think those were imposed so
that we would familiarize ourselves with the process. Still, it was different
having to be conscious of these requirements since in a more practical setting
you will make issues and write tests when you need to do those things, not to
meet some quota. I found myself very paranoid near the submission deadline as
well, not because I was rushing to the finish line, but because I was that I
missed something for a complete submission. I found the submission for this
assignment more complex than what I'm used to, and according to the
instructions, any anomallies in our submission will result in a resubmission
with a late penalty. I had probably made at least 10
commits meant for submission as I would constantly find that I was missing
something or that something was not up to date. The takeaway from this is to
get the projects submission-ready early so that it's easier to catch mistakes.

###What will you do next week?###

From my experience with this past project, I'll be getting an earlier start
on the next project, Netflix.

###Tip of the Week###

Be proficient at a shell scripting language like Bash. It will make your life
easier if you can write commands or scripts to do complex tasks that you would
otherwise do manually. Plus you will look so cool to your peers when you are
typing cryptic moonrunes into your terminal.
