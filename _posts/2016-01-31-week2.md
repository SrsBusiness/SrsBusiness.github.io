This week classes are pretty much in full swing. I can already tell that one
challenge this semester will be the sheer amount of readings in my classes.
Previously this was never really a problem before, but I've never taken so
many liberal arts classes until this semester. Incidentally, I believe this
semester sets a personal record of most textbooks purchased across my whole
college career.

I've had a slow start on the current Collatz project, mainly due to more
pressing deadlines for other classes. I've had maybe 2 labs and a homework
due already this past week. This coming week is definitely when Collatz gets
taken off the back burner.

One thing that has me taken back this week was the fact that my other CS
course, Software Design, is taught by a professor who seems to primarily
use Windows. We had just been assigned a lab that was intended to be done
on a Windows machine. I found this strange since I had the impression that
the CS department at UT is partial to teaching through Linux rather than
Windows. This is mainly through my experience in not only the CS department
but the ECE (Electrical and Computer Engineering) department as well.

Lectures for this class have followed pretty much the same routine. We have
a quiz at the start, and then we discuss the material as a class in the same
manner I mentioned in my last post. This week we focused a lot on Collatz
and on things like unit testing. I think it's good that we go over things like
testing because it's something that is rarely taught well in most CS classes
and is very important in the industry. Almost all successful software
companies have a rigorous testing discipline. Two helpful tips I've learned
this week are to pay close attention in lecture and to show up early. The reasons
being that quiz questions are often straight from the lecture seats fill up
rather quickly.

###Tip of the Week###

If you like making command-line applications, learn how to use ANSI escape
sequences. It lets you do things like colored text, blinking text, print
characters to a specific location in the terminal, etc. Most modern
terminals support them, like xterm. For example, try the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
$echo -e "\033[5mBlink\033[0m"
{% endhighlight %}
