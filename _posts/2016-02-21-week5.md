###What did you do this past week?###

This past week was focused on finishing up the Netflix assignment. In class we
discussed generators and how they work in Python. They are basically a special
type of iterator that will "yield" a collection of values one at a time instead
of computing all of them at once. They can be created using syntax that is
similar to list comprehensions, or through the use of the Python keyword
"yield".

###What's in your way?###

The quizzes have become more challenging in my opinion. Lately they have
contained very specific questions about the Python language. Since there is
a three minute time limit, I've started having more trouble than usual with
them. Based on the averages and from what I've heard from other students, this
seems to be true for most people. I'll probably have to review the lecture
notes more carefully from now on.

###What will you do next week?###

No project has been announced yet, and it does not look like there will be
one until after the first exam. For the time being I'll just concern myself
with knowing the material for the quizzes and start preparing for the exam.

###Tip of the Week###

[Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/)
I use this to share code snippets. It's kind of like pastebin but designed
for code (for example, it does syntax highlighting). I find it useful
when I want to share something small and creating a whole repository for
a code snippet seems like overkill. Though in reality every gist is a
git repository, all of that is abstracted away from the user. All you have
to do is copy-paste into the text field and share.

Another fun fact I learned recently is that Github will render emojis in
commit messages. Some may find this useful (or entertaining at the very
least) if, like me, you find that words alone cannot express the
significance of a commit. Here is a [cheatsheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)
for the different emojis supported by Github and many other tools.
